        The Avengers are a team of fictional superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, 
        based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963.
        Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States-based organization composed
        primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's protection 
        from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown 
        Manhattan and subsequently from the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York.

        was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury.[72] Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise 
        the role of Nick Fury from Iron Man's post-credits scene in the film's sequel, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson stated,
